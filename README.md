# Assignment-2
## Name of the project
This repository contains two simple tasks demonstrating basic programming concepts:
### Task 1: Checks if a number provided by the user is Even or Odd.
I have written three ways to solve Task 1 and used formatted(f) string to visualize actually entered number by user in result as odd or even.
1) by using Remainder method(%)
2) by using divison(/) = float free method(//)
3) by using integer method(int)
This clearly visible in my codes written in comment format.
One by one remove comment format and run the code to see the results from all the 3 codes.
### Task 2: Finds the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using loop.
Here, 1) I iterated numbers from 1 to 50 using loop via range function
2) Eventally, I found the sum of numbers from 1 to 50
